# Continue Here

This is the mandatory handoff entry point for every new Masanawa implementation session.

## Mission

Build Masanawa as one clean canonical platform from the strongest validated capabilities found across the pinned reference source vault.

Do not recreate donor project boundaries. Do not begin application feature implementation while Phase 0 remains open.

## Mandatory read order

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/VISION.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `docs/TECHNOLOGY.md`
5. `docs/SOURCE-OWNERSHIP.md`
6. `docs/REWRITE-PLAN.md`
7. `docs/migration/LANDSCAPE-EXPANSION.md`
8. `docs/migration/SOURCE-LOCK.md`
9. `references/README.md`
10. `references/SOURCES.md`
11. `docs/migration/FORENSICS-METHOD.md`
12. `docs/migration/FEATURE-LEDGER.md`
13. `docs/migration/BEHAVIOUR-LEDGER.md`
14. `docs/migration/DATA-LEDGER.md`
15. `docs/migration/INTEGRATION-LEDGER.md`
16. relevant files under `docs/migration/sources/`.

`docs/migration/LICENSE-LEDGER.md` is compliance/provenance metadata and is **not** part of architectural feature selection.

## Current phase

**Phase 3 — Identity and world.**

Phase 0A/0B, Phase 1 and Phase 2 are closed. Phase 2 closure evidence is in `docs/PHASE-2-CLOSURE-AUDIT.md`; Foundation CI run 213 passed the complete `pnpm check` gate on PostgreSQL 18 with 22 test files / 80 tests and production builds.

The active implementation line remains `phase2-closure` until PR #16 is merged. Do not recreate foundation lifecycle/readiness/authentication/recovery work.

## Immediate next work

Phase 3 is active. Canonical identity and the first world-generation foundation are merged to `main`. The current branch is `phase3-world-evidence-life-state`.

Completed on this branch:
- WorldEvent evidence now records generation, Character/CharacterVersion provenance, visibility, validity interval, occurrence key and canon lifecycle;
- approved and retired canon evidence is database-immutable;
- generation commits can carry CharacterLifeState changes and WorldEvent drafts in the same transaction;
- life-state writes require an active Character with a published active Constitution, use revision CAS and reject effective-time regression/future state;
- engine events may auto-approve only when WorldPolicy.automaticCanonEnabled is true;
- authored/imported events remain draft unless a later governed approval action promotes them;
- event occurrence keys are tenant/world-scoped and duplicate admission is rejected;
- PostgreSQL 18 tests cover automatic-canon policy, active Constitution binding, source CharacterVersion capture, life-state CAS, duplicate occurrence rejection and approved-event immutability.

Immediate work:
1. run the full PR/CI gate for `phase3-world-evidence-life-state` and fix every real failure;
2. after green CI, merge this evidence/life-state slice;
3. implement the explicit governed approval/retirement command for draft canon with AuthorityContext/ApprovalBinding checks rather than direct table mutation;
4. then add routines/story arcs using deterministic occurrence keys and the established generation/evidence path;
5. keep private User↔Character Relationship state outside shared world-event payloads and world projections.

Do not add a second world engine, second Character identity, or alternate relationship/memory authority.

## World simulation comparison — completed

ADR-0009 and `docs/migration/WORLD-SIMULATION-ADOPTION-BOUNDARY.md` decide:
- `packages/world` is the sole canonical world/life authority;
- AI Town supplies simulation-engine mechanics, not canonical domain objects;
- ChatWithStars supplies life-state/canon/governance semantics;
- durable world generations/claims replace process-local overlap locking;
- simulation time, wall-clock time, validity time and recorded time remain distinct;
- spatial simulation is optional;
- private relationship memory cannot mutate shared canon;
- memory, workflows, identity and presence consume world contracts without becoming world authority.

## Memory comparison — completed

ADR-0007 and `docs/migration/MEMORY-ADOPTION-BOUNDARY.md` decide:
- canonical memory record and scope model;
- relationship/private/shared/world separation;
- write/extraction lifecycle;
- provenance/evidence/confidence;
- working-context blocks versus durable memory;
- retrieval, entity/temporal indexing and reranking;
- reflection/consolidation/compaction;
- deletion/retention/tombstones;
- rebuildable vector/graph indexes;
- proactive memory recall versus explicit retrieval;
- evaluation/quality measurement;
- which donor components are safe to reuse directly versus adapt behind `packages/memory`.

Decision: `packages/memory` owns canonical scoped PostgreSQL records, provenance, lifecycle and context compilation. N.E.K.O/Letta Code/Mem0/OpenClaw are bounded donors only. Masanawa's type+scope privacy model remains non-negotiable.

## Non-negotiable rules

- One identity system.
- One memory system.
- One skill system.
- One tool registry.
- One agent execution framework.
- One provider registry.
- One event model.
- One task/workflow engine.
- One world model.
- Channels/device nodes are adapters, not alternate brains.
- Characters are domain entities, not prompts or agent classes.
- Providers/models/UIs never own business truth.
- Consequential side effects require deterministic validation, authorization, idempotency, reconciliation and audit.
- Private relationship memory never silently becomes shared character/world truth.
- Reference submodules are never production imports.
- No donor repository becomes a hidden runtime boundary.
- Licensing/provenance never decides feature survival. Useful donor capabilities remain A/B and are independently rewritten when direct reuse is unsuitable.
- Nothing is migrated without ledger evidence.

## Definition of done for Phase 0A — achieved 2026-10-01

Closure evidence: `docs/migration/PHASE-0A-CLOSURE-AUDIT.md`.

Phase 0A finished because:
- every expanded donor has a source map;
- its major relevant capabilities are represented in the ledgers;
- licenses/provenance are verified;
- the required cross-donor comparisons are complete;
- `docs/SOURCE-OWNERSHIP.md` no longer contains unresolved primary-candidate conflicts for foundation subsystems;
- donor decisions are recorded in ADRs where necessary.

## Definition of done for full Phase 0

Every meaningful capability in the pinned reference vault is classified:
- **A — preserve behaviour**
- **B — preserve capability, redesign implementation**
- **C — reference/retire explicitly**

Every retained capability has one canonical Masanawa destination and an acceptance/parity strategy.

## If context is missing

Do not ask the user to repeat previous discussions. The repository, source lock and reference vault are the source of truth.
