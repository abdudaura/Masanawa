This is the mandatory handoff entry point for every new Masanawa implementation session.

## Mission

Build Masanawa as one clean canonical platform from the strongest validated capabilities found across the pinned reference source vault.

Do not recreate donor project boundaries. Do not begin application feature implementation while Phase 0 remains open.

## Mandatory read order

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/VISION.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `docs/TECHNOLOGY.md`
5. `docs/SOURCE-OWNERSHIP.md`
6. `docs/REWRITE-PLAN.md`
7. `docs/migration/LANDSCAPE-EXPANSION.md`
8. `docs/migration/SOURCE-LOCK.md`
9. `references/README.md`
10. `references/SOURCES.md`
11. `docs/migration/FORENSICS-METHOD.md`
12. `docs/migration/FEATURE-LEDGER.md`
13. `docs/migration/BEHAVIOUR-LEDGER.md`
14. `docs/migration/DATA-LEDGER.md`
15. `docs/migration/INTEGRATION-LEDGER.md`
16. relevant files under `docs/migration/sources/`.

`docs/migration/LICENSE-LEDGER.md` is compliance/provenance metadata and is **not** part of architectural feature selection.

## Current phase

**Phase 3 — Identity and world.**

Phase 0A/0B, Phase 1 and Phase 2 are closed. Phase 2 closure evidence is in `docs/PHASE-2-CLOSURE-AUDIT.md`; Foundation CI run 213 passed the complete `pnpm check` gate on PostgreSQL 18 with 22 test files / 80 tests and production builds.

The active implementation line remains `phase2-closure` until PR #16 is merged. Do not recreate foundation lifecycle/readiness/authentication/recovery work.

## Immediate next work

Phase 3 is active. Canonical identity was merged to `main` in PR #17 at merge commit `75549800445842f8ff1db54e06529c075ed34ea4` after the full CI check passed.

Current implementation branch: `phase3-world-foundation`.

Completed on the current branch:
- `@masanawa/world` is active as the sole canonical world/life-state package;
- World, WorldPolicy, WorldGeneration, SimulationInput and CharacterLifeState contracts are defined;
- simulation time regression is rejected;
- catch-up policy is explicit rather than inferred from wall-clock gaps;
- package-owned world migration adds tenant-owned worlds, append-only generations, ordered/idempotent simulation inputs and Character life-state projection storage;
- PostgreSQL world repository admits idempotent inputs and rejects same-key/different-content conflicts;
- generation commits lock the current World, compare expected generation, reject stale writers, settle admitted inputs in the same transaction, append the next generation and advance the World projection;
- integration coverage includes a two-worker race proving only one expected-generation writer may commit, tenant-scoped reads, backward-time rejection and atomic input settlement.

Immediate work:
1. run PR/CI for `phase3-world-foundation` against PostgreSQL 18 and fix all real failures;
2. after green CI, merge the world foundation;
3. continue Phase 3 with governed CharacterLifeState writes plus WorldEvent/WorldInteraction evidence and Constitution-gated canon admission;
4. only after those invariants are durable, add routines/story arcs and optional spatial simulation.

Do not create another world engine, relationship store, or Character identity. World consumes canonical CharacterId; private Relationship data must never become shared World state implicitly.

The post-freeze MemPalace/Paperclip assessment remains in `docs/migration/POST-FREEZE-SUPPLEMENTAL-DONORS.md`. Neither is a Phase 3 runtime dependency.

## World simulation comparison — completed

ADR-0009 and `docs/migration/WORLD-SIMULATION-ADOPTION-BOUNDARY.md` decide:
- `packages/world` is the sole canonical world/life authority;
- AI Town supplies simulation-engine mechanics, not canonical domain objects;
- ChatWithStars supplies life-state/canon/governance semantics;
- durable world generations/claims replace process-local overlap locking;
- simulation time, wall-clock time, validity time and recorded time remain distinct;
- spatial simulation is optional;
- private relationship memory cannot mutate shared canon;
- memory, workflows, identity and presence consume world contracts without becoming world authority.

## Memory comparison — completed

ADR-0007 and `docs/migration/MEMORY-ADOPTION-BOUNDARY.md` decide:
- canonical memory record and scope model;
- relationship/private/shared/world separation;
- write/extraction lifecycle;
- provenance/evidence/confidence;
- working-context blocks versus durable memory;
- retrieval, entity/temporal indexing and reranking;
- reflection/consolidation/compaction;
- deletion/retention/tombstones;
- rebuildable vector/graph indexes;
- proactive memory recall versus explicit retrieval;
- evaluation/quality measurement;
- which donor components are safe to reuse directly versus adapt behind `packages/memory`.

Decision: `packages/memory` owns canonical scoped PostgreSQL records, provenance, lifecycle and context compilation. N.E.K.O/Letta Code/Mem0/OpenClaw are bounded donors only. Masanawa's type+scope privacy model remains non-negotiable.

## Non-negotiable rules

- One identity system.
- One memory system.
- One skill system.
- One tool registry.
- One agent execution framework.
- One provider registry.
- One event model.
- One task/workflow engine.
- One world model.
- Channels/device nodes are adapters, not alternate brains.
- Characters are domain entities, not prompts or agent classes.
- Providers/models/UIs never own business truth.
- Consequential side effects require deterministic validation, authorization, idempotency, reconciliation and audit.
- Private relationship memory never silently becomes shared character/world truth.
- Reference submodules are never production imports.
- No donor repository becomes a hidden runtime boundary.
- Licensing/provenance never decides feature survival. Useful donor capabilities remain A/B and are independently rewritten when direct reuse is unsuitable.
- Nothing is migrated without ledger evidence.

## Definition of done for Phase 0A — achieved 2026-10-01

Closure evidence: `docs/migration/PHASE-0A-CLOSURE-AUDIT.md`.

Phase 0A finished because:
- every expanded donor has a source map;
- its major relevant capabilities are represented in the ledgers;
- licenses/provenance are verified;
- the required cross-donor comparisons are complete;
- `docs/SOURCE-OWNERSHIP.md` no longer contains unresolved primary-candidate conflicts for foundation subsystems;
- donor decisions are recorded in ADRs where necessary.

## Definition of done for full Phase 0

Every meaningful capability in the pinned reference vault is classified:
- **A — preserve behaviour**
- **B — preserve capability, redesign implementation**
- **C — reference/retire explicitly**

Every retained capability has one canonical Masanawa destination and an acceptance/parity strategy.

## If context is missing

Do not ask the user to repeat previous discussions. The repository, source lock and reference vault are the source of truth.
